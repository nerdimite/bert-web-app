# Pre-Session Requisites

Before you attend the session "React Frontends for Data Scientists", there are a few pre-requisite steps like downloading the model and other files which are large in size so its better to download them before the start of the session.

### Downloads

1. Download the trained sentiment analysis model trained in our last session from [here](https://gradient-fire.s3.amazonaws.com/model.pth)
2. Download the bert-base-uncased model from [here](https://gradient-fire.s3.amazonaws.com/bert-base-uncased.rar)
3. Download the Inference Module for our model from [here](https://gradient-fire.s3.amazonaws.com/inference.py)
4. Download and Install Node.js for your respective operating system from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Python Dependencies

1. Python 3.6 (DON'T use Python 3.7)
2. PyTorch
3. Transformers

It is recommended to use Anaconda for installing python and managing python environments and libraries. You can find many resources online on setting up anaconda and using it.
